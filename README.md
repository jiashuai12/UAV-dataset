# UAV-dataset

The data comes from the UAV dataset constructed by the team, which consists of the 3D GPS reference trajectories and measurement trajectories of the UAV during its low-altitude flight at Beijing Technology and Business University (Liangxiang Campus), containing a total of 1456 sets of coordinate data. The path diagram of the UAV flight is shown in Figure 10, where the orange trajectory is GPS data. In order to obtain the accurate UAV reference trajectory, we used Pix4D software to make an accurate 3D reconstruction of the UAV flight video, and the final obtained reference trajectory is shown as a blue line in the figure.
